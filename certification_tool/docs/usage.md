HW Ð¡ertification usage
----------------------

1. Environment setup
--------------------

* Setup fuel http://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-6.0/user-guide.html#download-and-install-fuel
* You need a bash console on a computer, which have access to fuel master node
  Try to execute 'wget FUEL_URL'. It should be successful.

* You need python 2.7 and git
* Download certification tool from https://github.com/Mirantis/certification_tool.git

		$ git clone https://github.com/Mirantis/certification_tool.git

* Install next packages: python-yaml, python-argparse, python-netaddr, 
	python-keystoneclient
  	For ubuntu:

  		$ sudo apt-get install python-yaml python-argparse python-netaddr python-keystoneclient

  	For centos:

  		$ sudo yum install apt-get install python-yaml python-argparse python-netaddr python-keystoneclient

* Run certification tool and pass FUEL url and auth parameters to it. Tool is located in certification_tool/certification_tool/releases:
* 
		$ ./cert_tool.sh -a LOGIN:PASSWD:TENANT FUEL_URL

	E.g.

		$ ./cert_tool.sh -a admin:admin:admin http://172.16.50.200:8000/

	Certification tool would use all nodes, available at the moment 
	(but not less than two). If you would like to create cluster larger then XX nodes size - add '--min-nodes XX' parameter. E.g.:

		$ ./cert_tool.sh -a admin:admin:admin --min-nodes 10 http://172.16.50.200:8000/

* Follow the messages. When all slave nodes would be ready tool will create 
  test cluster and ask you to setup network parameters:

		> Please go to FUEL_CLUSTER_URL and configure network parameters. Then input 'ready' to continue :

  Open shown FUEL_CLUSTER_URL in our browser, login into FUEL, open certification_cluster and setup all 
  required network, parameters, accordingly to 
  http://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-6.0/user-guide.html#neutron-network-settings. Do **NOT** deploy cluster

  Then return to console, type 'ready' and press enter. Tool should proceed with cluster 
  installation. When installation complete tool would run test and print report
  to screen. Also report would be saved to the file with name like 
  HW_cert_report_XXXX.txt, where XXXX would be current unix time.
